# ABOUT ME
I am the founder of the YouTube channel NorthWestTrees Gaming.  
I play games and make videos for Let's Plays and tutorials for game-related software.  
I make Minecraft mods and MCreator Example Workspaces to help teach people how to use MCreator mods.  
I also am working on learning how to make pixel art and working on several projects in my spare time.
